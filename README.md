# Blog App

## What is this?

This is a simple blog app built with **Next.js** and **Bootstrap**.
You can **sign up**, **log in**, and **create, edit, or delete** blog posts — all right in your browser!
It saves everything using **localStorage**, so you don’t need a database or backend.

## Features

* Sign up and log in
* Stay logged in using localStorage
* Write new blog posts
* Edit your existing posts
* Delete posts you created
* Search posts by title or content
* Filter to see all blogs or just yours
* Mobile-friendly UI (Bootstrap)
* Fast page loads with Next.js
